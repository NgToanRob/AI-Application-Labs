# AI-Application-Labs
Basic algorithms of Machine Learning and Deep learning are implemented using tensorflow and pytorch

## Lab 1
Implement 3 common machine learning algorithms KNN, Logistic regression and SVM using sklearn. Compare their effectiveness in the task of detecting human motion using data from sensors
## Lab 2
Design and train an ANN model and use early stopping against overfiting. Use it to perform the famous task of predicting house prices

## Lab 3
Transfer learning CNN Resnet 50 model for flower classification
